A documentation hub highlighting my major learnings, tools, concepts, and personal growth throughout the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program.
This repository serves as a portfolio-style record of the knowledge and skills I acquired, challenges I faced, and the best practices that shaped my engineering journey.

🚀 Program Overview — ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering

The ProDev Frontend Engineering Program is an intensive, industry-aligned training focused on building real-world frontend engineering skills.
It combines theory, hands-on projects, system design, software engineering best practices, and modern toolchains used by professional frontend engineers.

Key goals of the program:

Build strong foundations in modern frontend development.

Learn frameworks and tools used in real companies.

Gain problem-solving skills and engineering thinking.

Develop professional-level documentation, collaboration, and Git/GitHub workflows.

🧗 3. Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented
Challenge	Solution
Understanding complex Next.js routing	Studied App Router docs + built small demo apps
Integrating third-party APIs	Implemented reusable API service modules
Handling UI state complexity	Used React context & custom hooks
Styling large projects	Adopted component-driven architecture with Tailwind
Debugging async operations	Used browser DevTools + console logging best practices
🧭 4. Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.

Commit frequently using meaningful commit messages.

Break problems into smaller solvable tasks.

Prioritize accessibility (a11y) and responsive UI.

Use GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests like a professional.

Never stop learning — frontend evolves fast!

Practice system design thinking even for small projects.

Develop the ability to debug efficiently and think through problems logically.
